<p><em>Elevating water </em>Is a speculative fiction base around the town of
Marfa, Texas. The text was produced in Colaboration with <a href="http://www.sarahjones.net.au/">Sarah
Jones</a> whilst on residency in Marfa, as a
part of <a href="taak.me/?lang=en">TAAK\'s Summer School</a>.</p>

<p><em>"Long before the fall the tower stood taller than the town hall.
Taller than the courthouse, the neon signs on the gas stations. Dwarfed
only by the distant ring of mountains, it shone endlessly in the desert.
It shone with the silver of a star, ignored and distant. Holding our
water but not our imaginations; a monument to the benign. It still
shines, but it shines here on the new ground, the risen ground. The
glittering sunspot is our obsession. We stare into its blinding light
and tell it over and over again of our tragedy. We tell the shining
tower, with a virulent regret, of how we gave it our train, our trees
and our mountains. We feed the tower the ghosts of everything it has
already swallowed. And the shining tower, in whose shadow we kneel, the
shining tower who took our town, is all we have left. It casts its
shadow inside of us and out, it is our only shade. We sit in its
darkness now and the sounds we make are echoed and reuttered for us by
our tower.2 We whistle into its darkness. It masters our voices as we
retell its story. Everything is smaller now. One hundred miles between
lilac and silver,3 reduced to a diameter of forty feet of steel.</em></p>
<p><em>Since we lost the things we loved to see, we have started to listen.
Sound is something else without the amphitheatre of the lost mountains.
It's something close to us that lives with hot breath in the empty
silver belly of our tower. We empty ourselves into the tower,
confessionally we flood its emptiness, as it flooded ours. We talk about
events that preceded the flood but the time lines have fallen apart, our
memories collide and collapse into one another. We can no longer date
the sculptures or the storms. We remember the explosion and we remember
the flood. Everything else is evaporating history and we know that as
our stories dissolve, our past straightens out into a fine line. First
the explosion, then the fall. The tower holds these things for us.
Nature eats everything else.\"</em></p>
<p>Footnote 2 Monuments and ruins act as "sentinel[s] of historicism"
(Sadek) within society, keeping the process of <em>history making</em> on a
linear trajectory. They intervene in the process of remembering and
forgetting. However, only monuments utilise a remembering forgetting in
order to sustain a perpetual forward motion regardless of the
ramifications. They do not implore an amnesia but instead, an assignment
of the present to the past, or a <em>putting on record</em>. This is manifested
in the use of commemoration over memory that removes the wound of the
event but maintains <em>honour</em> or potential for revenge.</p>
<p>Unlike the monument, the ruin dutifully retreats to allow an object to
act as "aestheticized dilapidation." (Sadek) This object holds "two
opposing tendencies of ruination and edification, of life and death"
from here we can either enter into the commemoration of past events,
mechanised through nostalgic formalism, or we can "stand outside
nostalgic formalism and recognize in the ruin the synthesis which
overcomes the terms of a false and ancient enmity." In order for the
ruin to convince us to commemorate, it is fundamental that it is not
current. Being in the past removes the ruin from a heightened state of
urgency. "In this form [the ruin], we thus feel the vitality of those
opposing tendencies-and, instinctively sensing these antitheses in
ourselves, we notice, beyond everything merely formal and aesthetic, the
significance of the configuration in whose serene unity they have their
synthesis." (Simmel 381) Like the monument, the ruin, stepped back from
urgency, is capable of commemoration over memory, which is fundamental
in the maintenance of a linear history.</p>
<p><em>Ruins perform their historicist role most fully when employed to
expedite the withdrawal of the negative from the present. In other
words, the catastrophe that may inhabit the present and bind it tight to
the crushing weight of its own unyielding presentness must be swiftly
evicted and efficiently framed as a ruin, lest our resident belief in a
planned and better future be hindered and jeopardized." (Sadek 1) Here,
Sadek describes how the ruin expedites the negative from the present and
into the past by masking the ramifications of past events.</em></p>
<p>Reza Negerastani's analysis of a ramification in relation to a
commitment to human can be used here to explain the nature of a
ramification on the present from the past: "By eroding the anchoring
link between present commitments and their past, and by seeing present
commitments from the perspective of their ramifications, revision forces
the updating of present commitments in a cascading fashion that spreads
globally over the entire system. The rational structure of a commitment,
or more specifically, of commitment to humanity, constructs the
opportunities of the present by cultivating the positive trends of the
past through the revisionary forces of the future." (Negarestani) If one
compares this orientation of the ramification - here through reason,
rather than through the disregard that takes place within Sadek's
definition of a monument or ruin - the anti-revisionary potential that
Sadek sets out above is exposed by Negerastani's commitment to human.
The present is "cultivated" through its connection to the past, rather
than through commemoration, which masks the past and in turn the
ramifications of the present.\"</p>
