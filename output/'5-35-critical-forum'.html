<p>5-35 was an opportunity for artists based in rural Aberdeenshire to
enter in to critical conversation around their work. The forum was based
at the Scottish Sculpture Workshop, leading the conversations to be
focused on a 'shop talk' or industry specific discourse.</p>
<p>"As the hangovers of discourse from Thursday night are now met by the
traditional hangover of a sunny Saturday morning; I felt it was the
right time to begin the online discourse that will hopefully supplement
our critical forum 5- 35. The feedback that I have received so far seems
good,Â focusing mainly on a constructive yet enjoyable time. I definitely
felt this was a warm meeting of peers and hopefully friends, and was
certainly not the critical Tomatina that a 'crit' can so often be. I'd
like to thank Joanna, Josh, Laura and Alan for sharing their practices
with us, and everyone else for attending and contributing. It would be
great if this email stream [now blog] could now become a way of
sharing the referrals that were maybe illegibly written down in the heat
of conversation and the brilliant eureka moments that came to us in the
car ride home. I'd like to start the ball rolling with a recommendation
for no one in particular; an article in this month's Art Monthly called
'Paul O'kane on making art'. Its on the first page but sadly isn't
available online. There is however a copy in the SSW library."</p>
