<p><em>To Make a Work</em> is a long running educational program, curated by
<a href="http://dutchartinstitute.eu/page/624/grant-watson">Grant Watson</a> and a
part of The DAI\'s Roaming academy. I took part in a trip to São Paulo,
Brazil in order to Research Molecular revolutions and develop a work in
progress, that we exhibited at <a href="http://casadopovo.org.br/">Casa do
Povo</a>.</p>
<p>\"This project will take the form of a one-year process of making a
work, and will explore how a regular monthly seminar can support this.
For the seminar the group will bring their research as well as their
collective questions to the table and track the process of making a work
individually and collectively, through its different stages from
conception to presentation. The seminar is a place to consider practice
but also to reflect on questions related to making a work more broadly
in terms of cultural politics. For this we propose to look at
subjectivity and micro-politics including through a reading of
schizo-analysis, in relation to artistic production coming out of our
approaches as artist, curator, and psychologist.</p>
<p>We propose to explore these questions as a group in the seminar, through
a series of readings and workshops, as well as during a research trip to
Brazil, a country where these issues have played an important role --
not only in politics and culture but also in clinical work. The research
trip will include a weeklong seminar at the Casa de Povo in São Paulo,
with as workshop leaders Suely Rolnik, Peter Pal Pelbert, Wanderely
Moreira Dos Santos, Paula Cheiffi, Yael Davids, Grant Watson and others.</p>

<p>In São Paulo I worked with <a href="http://www.julietaaguinaco.com/">Julieta
Aguinaco</a> and Sarah Demoen on a
continuation of out <em>Site of future trailer park</em> project. We jointly
wrote and performed a text titled <em>From one thing to something else.</em></p>
<p>The text will hopefully become available online.</p>
<p>Below is an extract from the text, the extracted section was written by
<a href="http://www.julietaaguinaco.com/">Julieta Aguinaco</a>:</p>
