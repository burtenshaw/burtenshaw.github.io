<p>Bio-Symphony: Oliver Jennings and Sarah Jones, curated by Ben Burtenshaw</p>
<p>In 2014 Oliver Jennings researched the life cycles of plants at
Devodama, a plant research institute in Italy. Whilst there Jennings
developed a sound work that using Devodama's technology analyses the
electrical impedance of a plant, and applies correlating audio to its
fluctuations.</p>
<p>For the Edinburgh Science Festival, the artists were interested in the
terms that art and science meet. For example how poetry can move beyond
the illustration of scientific data, and in turn how scientific data can
find an affective resonance through poetry.</p>
<p>Jones' poem <em>New things</em> was written in response to Jenning's first
work, specifically the moment when one encounters the familiar rhythm of
nature, mediated by technology. For this project though, Devodama's
technology has been applied to continuously reconfigure the stanzas of
Sarah Jones' poem.</p>
<p>Jennings' video work also titled <em>Bio-Symphony</em>, explains the
association of the plant and technology with his artistic practice. As
well as the specific stories and beliefs of Devodama, the inventors of
the technology. Their private eco-village in Italy has a very spiritual
understanding of why the plant can make sounds, which Jennings had to
understand in order to research this science.</p>
<p>Opening: 3rd April 2015, as part of <a href="http://www.sciencefestival.co.uk/event-details/how-the-light-gets-in">'How the lights get
in'</a>
@ <a href="http://www.summerhall.co.uk/">Summerhall</a>, during<a href="http://www.sciencefestival.co.uk/">Edinburgh science
festival.</a></p>
<p>Oliver Jenning's uses video and sound to reveal the inner workings of
natural structures. It\'s this inquisitive philosophy which led to his
work Every Object Has A Spirit [2012], which was concerned with
exploring and finding ways of generating patterns from life-cycles in
nature. Oliver's work wishes to explore past art's capacity to
illustrate science, and engage directly with the emotive and
psychological ramifications of what these patterns mean. Ultimately his
works aims to use technology to explore and understand nature.</p>
<p>Sarah Jones (1982) is an artist, writer and curator. Through first
person narrative, both written and performed, Sarah is interested in
exploring the micro-perceptual within the event, and the production of
these spaces, between the landscape and the body in movement. Sarah was
awarded her Masters of Fine Art, by the Dutch Art Institute (NL) in June
2014, after completing her Bachelor of Fine Arts at the University of
Tasmania (AUS) in 2007. She recently participated in the NOA Language
School at SMBA, Amsterdam (NL); and the TAAK - Marfa Summer School
Residency Program Texas (US). Her most recent exhibitions include: Felt
&amp; Fa(c)t, Ormston House Gallery, (IRE) 2014; The rise and fall of the
continuous cycle, DeServiceGarage, Amsterdam (NL) 2013; Come to Life at
the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, Launceston (AUS) 2012;
Youâ€™ll Always Be My # 1 at INFLIGHT ARI, Hobart (AUS) 2012.</p>
