<p>I am going to present to you two of the works from the publication I've
assembled, as a part of Casco's community in print. The publication, is
yet to be printed, but will include a video [contained on a DVD] ;
that I'll show. and 2 text's; one of which I'll read.</p>
<p>The publication explores the position of the individual or self within
producing a community. Focussing on the process that takes place when
one shares their 'self' with a community -- and how this relates to the
perpetual sharing of ones self, as a subject viewpoint, that takes place
in contemporary society.</p>
<p><em>Essentially what is it in this act of 'opening up' or becoming social
that eventually adds to, or takes away from a community? And when is a
closing down or<strong><em>retreat</em></strong>necessary to maintain one self; in turn the
community as a whole.</em></p>
<p>As a way of investigating, this act of retreat, or closing down to what
is sometimes called a 'safe place'. I started from the poem; <em>No man Is
an island</em> by Jon Donne, That was also the title of the publication. The
poem starts;</p>
<p>*No man is an island, Entire of itself, Every man is a piece of the
continent, A part of the main.*</p>
<p>Jon Donne's Poem embodies a notion of the self.  -  In the way that one
cannot separate the act of cutting from the knife; we cannot separate
the self, and the acts that manifest it, from our identity.</p>
<p>In order to explore this <strong>bound</strong> connection the publication intended
to make public, or share, the self  the island  using the only one
available: my own.</p>
<p>Sharing one\'s identity, or the personal characteristics that make it
up, is an inherent part of being in a community. Time spent within this
community, of any kind, but specifically when it transcends a
sensibility, allows individuals to access each other on a more personal
level; gradually learning what it is that makes up their respective
viewpoints. Reflected in Donne's poem by the lines, "Every man is a
piece of the continent, / A part of the main."</p>
<p>This transcendence from sensibility to community is a key intersection
within the construction of a community; <strong>to</strong> one that is able to
actually comprehend or know the viewpoint (subjectivities) of our
"comrades", rather than merely know <strong>of</strong> them. Of course, the sharing
or making public of our self is in no way rare. In a time when updating,
posting, and sharing is an integral part of everyday life, we
perpetually publish our inner subjectivities, for various means but
often with the undertone of "to be heard". So on a societal level the
act of constructing one's impossible island, is a retreat that in its
own farsity, highlights its inherent absence from the larger debate
around a community in contemporary society. A drive for community that
is of course not resolved by a retreat, but would come at this point of
permeability when sensibility mixes with community, <strong>or</strong> the
coastlines/ borders begin to open up to the continent.</p>
<p><strong>Play No Man is an Island Video</strong></p>
<p>| No man is an island,
| Entire of itself,
| Every man is a piece of the continent,
| A part of the main.
| If a clod be washed away by the sea,
| Europe is the less.
| As well as if a promontory were.
| As well as if a manor of thy friend\'s
| Or of thine own were:
| Any man\'s death diminishes me,
| Because I am involved in mankind,
| And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
| It tolls for thee.</p>
<p><strong>Read Balance not Substance by Sarah Jones</strong></p>
<p>In balance not substance,there is a continual switching taking place
between the position of the isolated and the other. The man's positions
is admired and desired, as if half of this community of two needs the
others halves attempts at retreat. But then ultimately she watches over
his house burn with a new sense of admiration; now as if he's lost his
island - forced to open up to the continent.</p>
<p>For this Publication this text takes the position of the other,
embodying the community or the outsider, through the man's attempts at
retreat. Where the video creates a farse at the idea of retreat from
within, by subjectifying the outsider as the person behind the camera,
balance not substance re-articulates this outside position to one that
encapsulates a wanting of permeability. In other words, whether retreat
is necessary or not, a community doesn't need it.</p>
<p>The video was made through a collaboration with Amir Avraham at the
werkplaats that in itself became somewhat of a case study of a
community, permeability and these <em>coastlines. -</em>That are evident within
artistic collaboration.</p>
<p>From the conception of this project, a specific statement has guided my
own understanding of the island: <em>what can you bring to the table?</em>
Essentially, what of you or of your practice is given to this shared
work? This act of sharing, or being appropriated <em>from</em> within a
collaboration is a relevant example of the breakdown of borders that
lead to a cohesive collaboration as an example of a community. Of course
this places a lot of ownership over ideas behind a work and in itself is
a detrimental avenue of thought in collaboration. But I raise the point
to ask: Can one only collaborate, only be a part of a community, or is
it integral to this process of sharing to retreat, to find a "safe
place" in an effort to return with more? Or does this process simply
entail being reminded of what you are in a time when the rising tide of
subjectivity that we experience as users  and also as artists 
seems to wash us away?</p>
