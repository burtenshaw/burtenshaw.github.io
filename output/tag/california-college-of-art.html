<p><strong>\"From May 26 to June 14 2014, 20 students from</strong><a href="http://dutchartinstitute.eu/">Dutch Art
Institute</a><strong>, the </strong><a href="http://www.gerritrietveldacademie.nl/en/sandberg-institute">Sandberg
Instituut/Gerrit Rietveld
Academie</a>** and *<em>`California
College of Arts (CCA) \&lt;http://www.cca.edu/>`__</em>* will stay
in <strong>`Building 98
\&lt;http://www.haciendadelarcon.org/Building98.html>`__</strong> in Marfa,
Texas. During the second edition of Summer School Marfa they will
explore this town in the high desert in West Texas, the impressive
landscape and the legendary works of Donald Judd. For three weeks they
will expand contemporary discourses, social practices and politics in
art. By creating a unique experience they will gain an understanding of
the dynamics and social impact of art in public spaces.  **</p>
<p>Marfa was built during the Texas oil boom in the late 19th century.
During the Mexican revolution (1910-1915), the US Army established a
presence in the outskirts.  The army maintained a presence during World
War 2. During the war, German prisoners of war were housed at the Fort
Russell where they obtained expansive murals of West Texas Living. In
1973 Judd moved to Marfa. He realized several large-scale artworks that
are inseparable from the desert landscape and commissioned his
contemporaries to develop art works in a former military fortress. Due
to the presence of the <a href="http://www.juddfoundation.org/">Judd
Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.chinati.org/">Chinati
Foundation</a>, Marfa became one of the major art
hubs in the U.S., a place where the art world meets and the cultural
industry is thriving.</p>
<p>Supervised by tutors from the participating institutions, students
examine the natural -- and cultural historical and sociological meanings
of the area. They analyze the different actors in the transformation of
the area and will critically relate to the value and importance of
public art in this specific context.</p>
<p><strong>The curriculum is built up around three different program lines;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A deep reading of the work and writings of Judd, the impact of his legacy on contemporary art, Marfa and the meaning of preservation.</li>
<li>An understanding and experience of the desert landscape, the impact of climate change and land use on it's ecology</li>
<li>The socio-political history and present of the town that nowadays provides a home for high art landscape and headquarters of National Security.</li>
</ul>
<p>During Summer School Marfa many subjects related to the conflicting
ideas and issues that arose with Judds arrival in Marfa and with his
legacy will be researched. These subjects include: the history of the
area, the border, the Mexican-American war, the geology, geography,
psychogeography of the region, the specifics of the town government as
well as a structural examination of the Judd -- and Chinati Foundation,
the expanding of the US border Patrol and the local Latino history.</p>
