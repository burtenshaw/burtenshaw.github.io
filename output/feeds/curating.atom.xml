&lt;p&gt;Bio-Symphony: Oliver Jennings and Sarah Jones, curated by Ben Burtenshaw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014 Oliver Jennings researched the life cycles of plants at
Devodama, a plant research institute in Italy. Whilst there Jennings
developed a sound work that using Devodama's technology analyses the
electrical impedance of a plant, and applies correlating audio to its
fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Edinburgh Science Festival, the artists were interested in the
terms that art and science meet. For example how poetry can move beyond
the illustration of scientific data, and in turn how scientific data can
find an affective resonance through poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones' poem &lt;em&gt;New things&lt;/em&gt; was written in response to Jenning's first
work, specifically the moment when one encounters the familiar rhythm of
nature, mediated by technology. For this project though, Devodama's
technology has been applied to continuously reconfigure the stanzas of
Sarah Jones' poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennings' video work also titled &lt;em&gt;Bio-Symphony&lt;/em&gt;, explains the
association of the plant and technology with his artistic practice. As
well as the specific stories and beliefs of Devodama, the inventors of
the technology. Their private eco-village in Italy has a very spiritual
understanding of why the plant can make sounds, which Jennings had to
understand in order to research this science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening: 3rd April 2015, as part of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencefestival.co.uk/event-details/how-the-light-gets-in"&gt;'How the lights get
in'&lt;/a&gt;
@ &lt;a href="http://www.summerhall.co.uk/"&gt;Summerhall&lt;/a&gt;, during&lt;a href="http://www.sciencefestival.co.uk/"&gt;Edinburgh science
festival.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oliver Jenning's uses video and sound to reveal the inner workings of
natural structures. It\'s this inquisitive philosophy which led to his
work Every Object Has A Spirit [2012], which was concerned with
exploring and finding ways of generating patterns from life-cycles in
nature. Oliver's work wishes to explore past art's capacity to
illustrate science, and engage directly with the emotive and
psychological ramifications of what these patterns mean. Ultimately his
works aims to use technology to explore and understand nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Jones (1982) is an artist, writer and curator. Through first
person narrative, both written and performed, Sarah is interested in
exploring the micro-perceptual within the event, and the production of
these spaces, between the landscape and the body in movement. Sarah was
awarded her Masters of Fine Art, by the Dutch Art Institute (NL) in June
2014, after completing her Bachelor of Fine Arts at the University of
Tasmania (AUS) in 2007. She recently participated in the NOA Language
School at SMBA, Amsterdam (NL); and the TAAK - Marfa Summer School
Residency Program Texas (US). Her most recent exhibitions include: Felt
&amp;amp; Fa(c)t, Ormston House Gallery, (IRE) 2014; The rise and fall of the
continuous cycle, DeServiceGarage, Amsterdam (NL) 2013; Come to Life at

pragmatism, through commitment [2] as a subject position. The idea
of losing individual authorship within collaboration inherently conjures
up ideas of a symbiotic working style, with two minds working as one.
And though this can often appear as a desirably &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; working model, it
has the potential to supply a hindering subject position for respective

&lt;p&gt;Tess Faria And Ben Burtenshaw will return the Anchor to Deptford high
street. The anchor was originally intended as a monument to Deptford\'s
maritime history. But in recent times had been appropriated by the
community to represent something new. In April 2013 it was removed by
Lewisham Council to create a "welcoming, open 'entrance' to the
street ".Through a one hour performance the anchor will be \'dropped\'
on to Deptford. With the help of the community the now silenced space at
the end of the high street will be re-appropriated. Highlighting how
this site has served to mediate with an altering local identity/ history
not always relevant to war. And what this silenced space now means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image_5" src="images/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/image_5.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The anchor that once adorned the High St will be \'dropped\' on to
Deptford. Participants will walk down the street collecting materials to
briefly reconstruct the anchor and then remove it after the 2 minute
silence. With the help of the community the now silenced space at the
end of the high street will be re-appropriated. Highlighting altered
local identity; separate to a maritime heritage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday 10th November : we are beginning to understand this performance
as an act of rekindling/ sparking, in a conflict between some of
Deptford\'s community and the development process taking place there.
The contingent we have assembled to join in this performance are key in
the rekindling/sparking process as sites of and potential sites of
disdain or activism. How they approach, ignore or come to terms with
this existing site of conflict will become evident over lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow a contingent of fourteen people will walk from The Albany,
Deptford to the south end of Deptford high street; the previous site of
an anchor monument. The contingent will lay down bin bags in the shape
of an anchor on the ground. We will wait for 2 minutes during the
organised silence and then remove the bags and return to the Albany.
After this we will meet back at our studio for a shared lunch in front
of the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;I\'m Daniel Gaffney, an anthropology graduate and English teacher. I participated in &lt;em&gt;turn right at the anchor, &lt;/em&gt;2013. I arrived at the Albany to see Tess Faria and Ben Burtenshaw sifting and filtering through a large pile of rubbish and filling bin bags. Ben then gave us a briefing on what we were about to do, at this point the event seemed disjointed from me and the other participants. We then began walking down the high street in a uniformed manner. Once we had "reconstructed the anchor" we observed the 2 minute silence. We then returned down the high street, and later met Tess and Ben at their studio for lunch. This element of the piece seemed fundamental in understanding what we\'d been a part of. Ben described how our involvement had made us sights of "disdain or activism". The explanation and theory of the event gave clarity to me and the others involved, the purpose was evident.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;LETTER ONE -- Participation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Members, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently become a member of Generator but have previouslyonly practiced outside of Dundee. In August, Generator will hostit's first ever Members General Meeting (MGM). This will be a curated response to the committee's performance, 'Opening', at the2013 Members' Show. For many organisations the AGM or MGM is a legal requirement andwill supply two main functions: To elect a committee and to enablemembers to have a say about the running of the organization, in turn
increasing accountability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next 3 months, I will ask members and the committee to raise open questions. I will then draft an itinerary and agenda fromthese; that highlights the collective concerns and confusions, in order to facilitate an open conversation. First of all I would like to ask for questions around member'sparticipation. For example; "Could members curate one show peryear?"Please could you reply to &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#109;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#64;&amp;#103;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#112;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#106;&amp;#101;&amp;#99;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;"&gt;&amp;#109;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#64;&amp;#103;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#112;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#106;&amp;#101;&amp;#99;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&lt;/a&gt; by the June 23rd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best, Ben Burtenshaw (GENERATORmember) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended the member's show in february: As a response to the performance which I perceived as a challenge on the involvement of member's outside of the annual show. I wish to propose a solo show at Generator Projects. I am a London based artist with no involvement, past my visit to your member's show, in the Dundee art community
. I am interested in becoming a fully fledged member and then exploring the role I can take within the organisation without any traditional participation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solo show in this instance representing the outlandish reward as a challenge to perceived lack in participation. Look forward to discussing this idea further with you, I have attached a CV and portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
