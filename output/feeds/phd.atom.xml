Offence in Dialogues: A Corpus-Based Study

&lt;h2&gt;Paper Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In  recent  years  an  increasing  number  of analyses  of  offensive  language  has  been published,  however,  dealing  mainly  with the automatic detection and classification of  isolated  instances.    In  this  paper  we aim  to  understand  the  impact  of  offensive messages in online conversations diachronically, and in particular the change in offensiveness of dialogue turns. In turn,we aim to measure the progression of of-fence  level  as  well  as  its  direction  –  For example,  whether a conversation is escalating or declining in offence.  We present our method of extracting linear dialogues from  tree-structured  conversations  in  social  media  data  and  make  our  code  publicly available.1Furthermore, we discuss methods  to  analyse  this  dataset  through changes  in  discourse  offensiveness.   Our paper  includes  two  main  contributions;first,  using  a  neural  network  to  measure the level of offensiveness in conversations;and second, the analysis of conversations around offensive comments using decoupling functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="PhD"></category><category term="NLP"></category><category term="Offence Detection"></category><category term="Toxicity"></category><category term="Johannes Schaefer"></category></entry><entry><title>Visiting Researcher at CISUC, The University of Coimbra</title><link href="/526.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-09T14:06:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-09T14:06:00+00:00</updated><author><name>burtenshaw</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-09-09:/526.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past six months I have worked with &lt;a href="https://www.uni-hildesheim.de/~schae010/publications.html"&gt;Johannes Schafer&lt;/a&gt; from The University of Hildesheim, on detecting offensive and toxic comments in machine generated language. This a protracted and nuanced task, that should become an integral part of my PhD. As yet we have been able to detect conversation 'Offence Direction', i.e. whether conversations are becoming more or less offensive. This novel outcome has used a bespoke Reddit dataset, the code for which we've &lt;a href="https://github.com/burtenshaw/offence-detection"&gt;published on github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020 we will publish a long paper on the details of this metric:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Paper Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper outlines an ongoing corpus study and gradient based search of conversations by offence probability direction; for example, becoming more or less offensive. With the motivation of retrieving examples of humans' conversational tactics against offence. Such a database would be a lucrative resource in evaluating dialogue systems on the same task, where a central challenge is dealing with offensive input. This problem is compounded when working in ethically sensitive areas, where replies should be validated and context appropriate. Literature from care and pedagogy advises professionals that when subjects become offensive, methods like expansion, clarification, and adaptation are necessary rather than warning alone. By appropriately handling the offence, the professional carer removes blame and opens the door for the subject to process their intention. However, these nuanced and delicate forms of language are challenging to implement in a dialogue system, from conceptual literature alone. We use state of the art offence classification from the recent Offenseval 2019 Task 6. We predict an offence direction based on linear gradients of the classification probability. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="PhD"></category><category term="CLiPS"></category><category term="EMRG"></category><category term="ACDC"></category><category term="Hildesheim"></category><category term="Johannes Schaefer"></category><category term="NLG"></category><category term="AI &amp; ETHICS"></category></entry><entry><title>The Internet of Things</title><link href="/481.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-12T07:24:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-04-12T07:24:00+00:00</updated><author><name>burtenshaw</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-04-12:/481.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Presentation : Synthetic Literature - Writing Science Fiction in a Co-Creative Process - Ben Burtenshaw (The University of Antwerp)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic literature refers to stories written with and by machines. The lecture outlines a natural language generation project named Asibot, that allowed members of the public to collaborate in the writing of a science fiction story with a neural network based text generator. Crucially, the system set up a collaborative environment, through which users were able to creatively write. The lecture will focus on the ramifications of this creative process, and go in to detail on how one evaluates and analyses it. It would be interesting for those working with natural language generation or processing, as well those who are interested in recent developments in the fields of computational creativity and story generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Workshop Asibot, Under the Hood - Ben Burtenshaw &amp;amp; Enrique Manjavacas (The University of Antwerp)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, Ben Burtenshaw will follow up on his plenary lecture, and show participants how the Asibot system works on a more practical level. You will get the opportunity to interact with the Asibot system, a neural network based text generator that wrote a science fiction story in collaboration with Dutch writer Ronald Giphart. Since the project’s public completion, researchers at the The University of Antwerp and The Meertens Institute have been analysing how Asibot was used. The workshop will delve into these findings, and explain how these methodologies can be reused in participants’ own projects.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="PhD"></category><category term="The Internet of Things"></category><category term="Asibot"></category><category term="Language Generation"></category><category term="Conference"></category><category term="Workshop"></category><category term="Invited Talk"></category></entry><entry><title>Asibot</title><link href="/asibot.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-12T07:23:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-04-12T07:23:00+00:00</updated><author><name>burtenshaw</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-04-12:/asibot.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper describes a co-creative text gener-ation system applied within a science fictionsetting to be used by an established novelist.The project was initiated as part of The DutchBook  Week,  and  the  generated  text  will  bepublished within a volume of science fictionstories. We explore the ramifications of apply-ing Natural Language Generation within a co-creative process,  and examine where the co-creative setting challenges both writer and ma-chine.  We employ a character-level languagemodel to generate text based on a large corpusof Dutch novels that exposes a number of tun-able parameters to the user. The system is usedthrough a custom graphical user interface, thathelps  the  writer  to  elicit,  modify  and  incor-porate suggestions by the text generation sys-tem. Besides a literary work, the output of thepresent  project  also  includes  user-generatedmeta-data that is expected to contribute to thequantitative evaluation of the text-generationsystem and the co-creative process involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIStories is a proposed interactive dialogue system, that lets children
co-create narrative worlds through conversation. Over the next three
years this system will be developed and tested within pediatric wards,
where it offers a useful resource between the gap of education and play.
Telling and making stories is a fundamental part of language play, and
its chatty and nonsensical qualities are important; therefore, the
prologued usage an automated system offers is a benefit to children. In
this paper I will present the current state of this project, in its more
experimental and general guise.Conceptually story-telling through
dialogue relates to the pre-print interpretation of story, beyond the
static and linear medium, where stories were performative, temporal, and
social.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper Extract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories play a vital role in the lives of children. The alternative
worlds they produce encourage imagination and creativity, but also
transform knowledge into structures that children can understand and
relate to. We present an interactive story system that creates
narratives from Wikipedia articles, and reveals them through dialogue
with a user. Using state-of-the-art narrative generation tools and a
chatbot dialogue system, information from Wikipedia is revealed to the
child based on their input. Generating narratives from any text has long
been a goal of Artificial Intelligence researchers because narrative
structures are useful for learners of all ages. However, many of the
existing story generation systems have relied on hand - written
techniques that cannot meet the scale of data online. In recent years
search - based systems have been able to incorporate broader topics, but
they have sacrificed continuity, producing fragmented narrative. Here we
propose a search - based system that scours Wikipedia for articles
relating to user input, and then restricts its generation material to
that article; in doing so, the system utilises the defined topic and
chronology of the article to retain context.&lt;/p&gt;
