&lt;h1&gt;Workshop Description&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From : https://www.cais.nrw/veranstaltungen/what-is-the-art-in-artificial-intelligence/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUSI.ai: What is the Art in Artificial Intelligence? brings together a group of international researchers in an open and experimental format that explores the ‘future of search’ with an opensource personal assistant &lt;a href="https://skills.susi.ai/"&gt;SUSI.ai&lt;/a&gt;. With hands-on interaction and a ‘behind the scenes’ in-depth analysis by Michael Christen, along with the interests and expertise of the participants, the event will focus on teaching ‘art’ to artificial intelligence – contributing content to SUSI’s library of potential answers  so that it could ‘learn’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event also intends to investigate some of the consequences of feeding and training AI concerning digital labour and gender bias with Personal Assistants along with ‘surveillance activities’ in the home and office. Besides linguistic understanding, ethics of AI will also be explored regarding questions of teaching AI and ways  in which AI could be trained differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Paper Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In  recent  years  an  increasing  number  of analyses  of  offensive  language  has  been published,  however,  dealing  mainly  with the automatic detection and classification of  isolated  instances.    In  this  paper  we aim  to  understand  the  impact  of  offensive messages in online conversations diachronically, and in particular the change in offensiveness of dialogue turns. In turn,we aim to measure the progression of of-fence  level  as  well  as  its  direction  –  For example,  whether a conversation is escalating or declining in offence.  We present our method of extracting linear dialogues from  tree-structured  conversations  in  social  media  data  and  make  our  code  publicly available.1Furthermore, we discuss methods  to  analyse  this  dataset  through changes  in  discourse  offensiveness.   Our paper  includes  two  main  contributions;first,  using  a  neural  network  to  measure the level of offensiveness in conversations;and second, the analysis of conversations around offensive comments using decoupling functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="PhD"></category><category term="NLP"></category><category term="Offence Detection"></category><category term="Toxicity"></category><category term="Johannes Schaefer"></category></entry><entry><title>Visiting Researcher at CISUC, The University of Coimbra</title><link href="/526.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-09T14:06:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-09-09T14:06:00+00:00</updated><author><name>burtenshaw</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-09-09:/526.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past six months I have worked with &lt;a href="https://www.uni-hildesheim.de/~schae010/publications.html"&gt;Johannes Schafer&lt;/a&gt; from The University of Hildesheim, on detecting offensive and toxic comments in machine generated language. This a protracted and nuanced task, that should become an integral part of my PhD. As yet we have been able to detect conversation 'Offence Direction', i.e. whether conversations are becoming more or less offensive. This novel outcome has used a bespoke Reddit dataset, the code for which we've &lt;a href="https://github.com/burtenshaw/offence-detection"&gt;published on github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020 we will publish a long paper on the details of this metric:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Paper Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper outlines an ongoing corpus study and gradient based search of conversations by offence probability direction; for example, becoming more or less offensive. With the motivation of retrieving examples of humans' conversational tactics against offence. Such a database would be a lucrative resource in evaluating dialogue systems on the same task, where a central challenge is dealing with offensive input. This problem is compounded when working in ethically sensitive areas, where replies should be validated and context appropriate. Literature from care and pedagogy advises professionals that when subjects become offensive, methods like expansion, clarification, and adaptation are necessary rather than warning alone. By appropriately handling the offence, the professional carer removes blame and opens the door for the subject to process their intention. However, these nuanced and delicate forms of language are challenging to implement in a dialogue system, from conceptual literature alone. We use state of the art offence classification from the recent Offenseval 2019 Task 6. We predict an offence direction based on linear gradients of the classification probability. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="PhD"></category><category term="CLiPS"></category><category term="EMRG"></category><category term="ACDC"></category><category term="Hildesheim"></category><category term="Johannes Schaefer"></category><category term="NLG"></category><category term="AI &amp; ETHICS"></category></entry><entry><title>The Internet of Things</title><link href="/481.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-12T07:24:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-04-12T07:24:00+00:00</updated><author><name>burtenshaw</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-04-12:/481.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Presentation : Synthetic Literature - Writing Science Fiction in a Co-Creative Process - Ben Burtenshaw (The University of Antwerp)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic literature refers to stories written with and by machines. The lecture outlines a natural language generation project named Asibot, that allowed members of the public to collaborate in the writing of a science fiction story with a neural network based text generator. Crucially, the system set up a collaborative environment, through which users were able to creatively write. The lecture will focus on the ramifications of this creative process, and go in to detail on how one evaluates and analyses it. It would be interesting for those working with natural language generation or processing, as well those who are interested in recent developments in the fields of computational creativity and story generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Workshop Asibot, Under the Hood - Ben Burtenshaw &amp;amp; Enrique Manjavacas (The University of Antwerp)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, Ben Burtenshaw will follow up on his plenary lecture, and show participants how the Asibot system works on a more practical level. You will get the opportunity to interact with the Asibot system, a neural network based text generator that wrote a science fiction story in collaboration with Dutch writer Ronald Giphart. Since the project’s public completion, researchers at the The University of Antwerp and The Meertens Institute have been analysing how Asibot was used. The workshop will delve into these findings, and explain how these methodologies can be reused in participants’ own projects.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="PhD"></category><category term="The Internet of Things"></category><category term="Asibot"></category><category term="Language Generation"></category><category term="Conference"></category><category term="Workshop"></category><category term="Invited Talk"></category></entry><entry><title>Asibot</title><link href="/asibot.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-12T07:23:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-04-12T07:23:00+00:00</updated><author><name>burtenshaw</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-04-12:/asibot.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper describes a co-creative text gener-ation system applied within a science fictionsetting to be used by an established novelist.The project was initiated as part of The DutchBook  Week,  and  the  generated  text  will  bepublished within a volume of science fictionstories. We explore the ramifications of apply-ing Natural Language Generation within a co-creative process,  and examine where the co-creative setting challenges both writer and ma-chine.  We employ a character-level languagemodel to generate text based on a large corpusof Dutch novels that exposes a number of tun-able parameters to the user. The system is usedthrough a custom graphical user interface, thathelps  the  writer  to  elicit,  modify  and  incor-porate suggestions by the text generation sys-tem. Besides a literary work, the output of thepresent  project  also  includes  user-generatedmeta-data that is expected to contribute to thequantitative evaluation of the text-generationsystem and the co-creative process involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIStories is a proposed interactive dialogue system, that lets children
co-create narrative worlds through conversation. Over the next three
years this system will be developed and tested within pediatric wards,
where it offers a useful resource between the gap of education and play.
Telling and making stories is a fundamental part of language play, and
its chatty and nonsensical qualities are important; therefore, the
prologued usage an automated system offers is a benefit to children. In
this paper I will present the current state of this project, in its more
experimental and general guise.Conceptually story-telling through
dialogue relates to the pre-print interpretation of story, beyond the
static and linear medium, where stories were performative, temporal, and
social.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper Extract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories play a vital role in the lives of children. The alternative
worlds they produce encourage imagination and creativity, but also
transform knowledge into structures that children can understand and
relate to. We present an interactive story system that creates
narratives from Wikipedia articles, and reveals them through dialogue
with a user. Using state-of-the-art narrative generation tools and a
chatbot dialogue system, information from Wikipedia is revealed to the
child based on their input. Generating narratives from any text has long
been a goal of Artificial Intelligence researchers because narrative
structures are useful for learners of all ages. However, many of the
existing story generation systems have relied on hand - written
techniques that cannot meet the scale of data online. In recent years
search - based systems have been able to incorporate broader topics, but
they have sacrificed continuity, producing fragmented narrative. Here we
propose a search - based system that scours Wikipedia for articles
relating to user input, and then restricts its generation material to
that article; in doing so, the system utilises the defined topic and
chronology of the article to retain context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concurrent to global post-financial crisis politics, a theory for a
contemporary prometheanism has been carving itself out from different
strands of philosophy and transdisciplinary research. As an event,
Prometheanism 2.0 is a condensed and partial account of this strain of
thought that cuts across rationalism, pragmatism, realism, materialism,
science, technology, computation, economics, politics, and art to shape
its foundations. It attempts to articulate the major positions,
concerns, and questions for a contemporary prometheanism through both
theoretical talks and artistic representations. In which sense can art
practice be promethean? Where does the urge come from? Why and how
should art take on this challenge? This event hopes to bring to the
table discussions and questions regarding a contemporary promethean
position and its embrace in art practice, contributing to further
sharpening, clarifying, and formulating a prometheanism 2.0 that, to an
extent, still remains germinal. &lt;a href="http://dutchartinstitute.eu/page/8367/prometheanism-2-0-introduction-part-2"&gt;READ

&lt;p&gt;Description of my contribution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often when we attempt to visualise prometheanism, we use some version of
science-fiction cyborg as technology's best effort at human, a Human
2.0. But prometheanism is more nuanced than just advancement. To see
this, we need to look past humans running faster and living longer in a
distant utopian future, and put prometheanism alongside other planetary
scaled challenges. Beyond Cyborgs attempts to ignore the initial desire
for advancement, that prometheanism conjures up, and instead asks 'what
does prometheanism look like in a state of survival?' To grasp this
interpretation, the audio performance samples science fiction novels
which move beyond the traditional cyborg in cinematic portrayals. These
narratives tackle humanity through complex uses of prometheanism, based
on technologies completely separate from our own. They are based on
biological or psychological enhancement, rather than digital technology.
Through this they offer a version of prometheanism that can be applied
to contemporary issues, without seeming far-fetched.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Art &amp; Technology"></category><category term="'2016"></category><category term="Arnhem"></category><category term="Bassam el Baroni"></category><category term="DAI"></category><category term="Prometheanism'"></category></entry><entry><title>'did you feel it?'

&lt;h1&gt;The Premise of the symposium&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symposium &lt;a href="http://dutchartinstitute.eu/page/7263/didyoufeelitjoinusforadaylongsymposiumcuratedandorganizedbyst"&gt;"did you feel it
?"&lt;/a&gt;
will approach the concern of how affect manifests through technology, by
taking the idea of the interface as a way of understanding the creation
and mediation of affective forces and their influence on our social,
political and artistic encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affect can be defined as as "a pre-personal intensity corresponding to
the passage from one experiential state of the body to another and
implying an augmentation or diminution in that body\'s capacity to act."
(Brian Massumi) In our contemporary situation these experiential states
and feelings are readily exchanged and traded upon in many areas of
life: Your Facebook friends are editing and mediating their lives so
that you can engage with them through liking and sharing. News media
increasingly appeals to us on an affective register, influencing our
reactions from occupation to commodification. With the growth of the
service industry, an increasing number of workers no longer merely
exchange the labour of their bodies, rather they exchange on an
affective spectrum, like the call centre worker who must present a
relentless kind and civil demeanor, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do in the media is enabled and disabled by interfaces. The
interface is the ubiquitous and largely hidden layer between human and
machine, but its transparency does not make it neutral. It is also an
autonomous zone of aesthetic activity, guided by its own logic and its
own ends. (Alexander Galloway). The interface permanently shapes our
view of the material, the social, the political and the technological.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay (part of the &lt;em&gt;Open!&lt;/em&gt; Co-Op Academy project "did you feel
it?") is concerned with how affective forces move through our
technological encounters and how technology itself can alter these, as
well as their perception within our brain. It's not so much about the
exchanges between one another, as about the situations where other,
non-human, intelligences come into the fray. How and where do these
intelligences manifest and what psychology do they bring about? In the
latter part of the essay, I'll compare some examples with existing
theories of affective labour in order to give us an idea of what could
come of these forces in the future. Affective labour has become central
to consumer capitalism, seen in the prevalence of roles like the call
centre worker, and so related theories can show how capital already
functions affectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open!&lt;/em&gt; is an Amsterdam-based publication platform that fosters and
disseminates experimental knowledge on art, culture and the public
domain. &lt;em&gt;Open!&lt;/em&gt; explores the changing conditions of the public domain
and new viewpoints on publicness from a variety of international and
interdisciplinary perspectives. &lt;em&gt;Open!&lt;/em&gt; addresses the commons and the
community, ownership and power relationships, and it examines the
consequences of current privatisation, mediatisation and
globalisation processes on our social and artistic practices. &lt;em&gt;Open!&lt;/em&gt;
works with theorists, artists and designers who contribute to the
creation of an experimental and critical body of thought. &lt;em&gt;Open!&lt;/em&gt; is an
independent organisation and the online continuation of &lt;em&gt;Open. Cahier on
Art &amp;amp; the Public Domain&lt;/em&gt;, the biannual print publication that existed

&lt;p&gt;The Garden Thrives by Jam city is a severe and grating beat, with
interludes of soft and easy funk. It will start the presentation, and
then be interrupted by a sound work based on running. This will then be
elaborated on and mused on by poet Alex Jeronymides-Norie. After which
I'll present the research over the last year that has led up to this
presentation; relating to, artificial intelligence, prometheanism,
consumer sport science.&lt;/p&gt;

present a 20 minute final lecture-performance. Other than the
constraints of the framework of time and space there are no restrictions
to the content of the presentation. Following each performance, in a
conversational mode, (invited)respondents reflect on the presentation
while simultaneously engaging with a well considered key question,
brought forward by each presenter at the beginning of her presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio-Symphony: Oliver Jennings and Sarah Jones, curated by Ben Burtenshaw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014 Oliver Jennings researched the life cycles of plants at
Devodama, a plant research institute in Italy. Whilst there Jennings
developed a sound work that using Devodama's technology analyses the
electrical impedance of a plant, and applies correlating audio to its
fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Edinburgh Science Festival, the artists were interested in the
terms that art and science meet. For example how poetry can move beyond
the illustration of scientific data, and in turn how scientific data can
find an affective resonance through poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones' poem &lt;em&gt;New things&lt;/em&gt; was written in response to Jenning's first
work, specifically the moment when one encounters the familiar rhythm of
nature, mediated by technology. For this project though, Devodama's
technology has been applied to continuously reconfigure the stanzas of
Sarah Jones' poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennings' video work also titled &lt;em&gt;Bio-Symphony&lt;/em&gt;, explains the
association of the plant and technology with his artistic practice. As
well as the specific stories and beliefs of Devodama, the inventors of
the technology. Their private eco-village in Italy has a very spiritual
understanding of why the plant can make sounds, which Jennings had to
understand in order to research this science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oliver Jenning's uses video and sound to reveal the inner workings of
natural structures. It\'s this inquisitive philosophy which led to his
work Every Object Has A Spirit [2012], which was concerned with
exploring and finding ways of generating patterns from life-cycles in
nature. Oliver's work wishes to explore past art's capacity to
illustrate science, and engage directly with the emotive and
psychological ramifications of what these patterns mean. Ultimately his
works aims to use technology to explore and understand nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Jones (1982) is an artist, writer and curator. Through first
person narrative, both written and performed, Sarah is interested in
exploring the micro-perceptual within the event, and the production of
these spaces, between the landscape and the body in movement. Sarah was
awarded her Masters of Fine Art, by the Dutch Art Institute (NL) in June
2014, after completing her Bachelor of Fine Arts at the University of
Tasmania (AUS) in 2007. She recently participated in the NOA Language
School at SMBA, Amsterdam (NL); and the TAAK - Marfa Summer School
Residency Program Texas (US). Her most recent exhibitions include: Felt

Brazil in order to Research Molecular revolutions and develop a work in
progress, that we exhibited at &lt;a href="http://casadopovo.org.br/"&gt;Casa do
Povo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\"This project will take the form of a one-year process of making a
work, and will explore how a regular monthly seminar can support this.
For the seminar the group will bring their research as well as their
collective questions to the table and track the process of making a work
individually and collectively, through its different stages from
conception to presentation. The seminar is a place to consider practice
but also to reflect on questions related to making a work more broadly
in terms of cultural politics. For this we propose to look at
subjectivity and micro-politics including through a reading of
schizo-analysis, in relation to artistic production coming out of our
approaches as artist, curator, and psychologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose to explore these questions as a group in the seminar, through
a series of readings and workshops, as well as during a research trip to
Brazil, a country where these issues have played an important role --
not only in politics and culture but also in clinical work. The research
trip will include a weeklong seminar at the Casa de Povo in São Paulo,
with as workshop leaders Suely Rolnik, Peter Pal Pelbert, Wanderely
Moreira Dos Santos, Paula Cheiffi, Yael Davids, Grant Watson and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\"Community in Print focuses on serial publishing inspired by
art-publishing enterprises that were for the most part in series form:
from magazines prevalent in the 1970s like the American counterculture
catalog, published by writer Stewart Brand, Whole Earth Catalog or the
collective General Idea's FILE magazine, to more contemporary examples
such as artist, critic, philosopher, and writer workgroup Chto Delat's
newspaper that takes the name of the collective, the bilingual magazine
Pages, which looks into the Iranian context and initiated by Nasrin
Tabatabai &amp;amp; Babak Afrassiabi or artist Can Atlay's journal Ahali. What
is significantly in common among them, are their self-institutional
agency. Be the vehicle a journal, magazine, or periodical, they offer a
space for ongoing, self-disciplinary practices of artistic research.
This space, in turn, forms a community of readers and interferes in
existing cultural spheres. \" &lt;a href="http://cascoprojects.org/community-in-print-the-fourth-edition-of-publishing-class-2013-2014"&gt;(Casco,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Long before the fall the tower stood taller than the town hall.
Taller than the courthouse, the neon signs on the gas stations. Dwarfed
only by the distant ring of mountains, it shone endlessly in the desert.
It shone with the silver of a star, ignored and distant. Holding our
water but not our imaginations; a monument to the benign. It still
shines, but it shines here on the new ground, the risen ground. The
glittering sunspot is our obsession. We stare into its blinding light
and tell it over and over again of our tragedy. We tell the shining
tower, with a virulent regret, of how we gave it our train, our trees
and our mountains. We feed the tower the ghosts of everything it has
already swallowed. And the shining tower, in whose shadow we kneel, the
shining tower who took our town, is all we have left. It casts its
shadow inside of us and out, it is our only shade. We sit in its
darkness now and the sounds we make are echoed and reuttered for us by
our tower.2 We whistle into its darkness. It masters our voices as we
retell its story. Everything is smaller now. One hundred miles between
lilac and silver,3 reduced to a diameter of forty feet of steel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since we lost the things we loved to see, we have started to listen.
Sound is something else without the amphitheatre of the lost mountains.
It's something close to us that lives with hot breath in the empty
silver belly of our tower. We empty ourselves into the tower,
confessionally we flood its emptiness, as it flooded ours. We talk about
events that preceded the flood but the time lines have fallen apart, our
memories collide and collapse into one another. We can no longer date
the sculptures or the storms. We remember the explosion and we remember
the flood. Everything else is evaporating history and we know that as
our stories dissolve, our past straightens out into a fine line. First
the explosion, then the fall. The tower holds these things for us.
Nature eats everything else.\"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footnote 2 Monuments and ruins act as "sentinel[s] of historicism"
(Sadek) within society, keeping the process of &lt;em&gt;history making&lt;/em&gt; on a
linear trajectory. They intervene in the process of remembering and
forgetting. However, only monuments utilise a remembering forgetting in
order to sustain a perpetual forward motion regardless of the
ramifications. They do not implore an amnesia but instead, an assignment
of the present to the past, or a &lt;em&gt;putting on record&lt;/em&gt;. This is manifested
in the use of commemoration over memory that removes the wound of the
event but maintains &lt;em&gt;honour&lt;/em&gt; or potential for revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the monument, the ruin dutifully retreats to allow an object to
act as "aestheticized dilapidation." (Sadek) This object holds "two
opposing tendencies of ruination and edification, of life and death"
from here we can either enter into the commemoration of past events,
mechanised through nostalgic formalism, or we can "stand outside
nostalgic formalism and recognize in the ruin the synthesis which
overcomes the terms of a false and ancient enmity." In order for the
ruin to convince us to commemorate, it is fundamental that it is not
current. Being in the past removes the ruin from a heightened state of
urgency. "In this form [the ruin], we thus feel the vitality of those
opposing tendencies-and, instinctively sensing these antitheses in
ourselves, we notice, beyond everything merely formal and aesthetic, the
significance of the configuration in whose serene unity they have their
synthesis." (Simmel 381) Like the monument, the ruin, stepped back from
urgency, is capable of commemoration over memory, which is fundamental
in the maintenance of a linear history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruins perform their historicist role most fully when employed to
expedite the withdrawal of the negative from the present. In other
words, the catastrophe that may inhabit the present and bind it tight to
the crushing weight of its own unyielding presentness must be swiftly
evicted and efficiently framed as a ruin, lest our resident belief in a
planned and better future be hindered and jeopardized." (Sadek 1) Here,
Sadek describes how the ruin expedites the negative from the present and
into the past by masking the ramifications of past events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reza Negerastani's analysis of a ramification in relation to a
commitment to human can be used here to explain the nature of a
ramification on the present from the past: "By eroding the anchoring
link between present commitments and their past, and by seeing present
commitments from the perspective of their ramifications, revision forces
the updating of present commitments in a cascading fashion that spreads
globally over the entire system. The rational structure of a commitment,
or more specifically, of commitment to humanity, constructs the
opportunities of the present by cultivating the positive trends of the
past through the revisionary forces of the future." (Negarestani) If one
compares this orientation of the ramification - here through reason,
rather than through the disregard that takes place within Sadek's
definition of a monument or ruin - the anti-revisionary potential that
Sadek sets out above is exposed by Negerastani's commitment to human.
The present is "cultivated" through its connection to the past, rather
than through commemoration, which masks the past and in turn the
ramifications of the present.\"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publication explores the position of the individual or self within
producing a community. Focussing on the process that takes place when
one shares their 'self' with a community -- and how this relates to the
perpetual sharing of ones self, as a subject viewpoint, that takes place
in contemporary society.&lt;/p&gt;

that eventually adds to, or takes away from a community? And when is a
closing down or&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;retreat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;necessary to maintain one self; in turn the
community as a whole.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a way of investigating, this act of retreat, or closing down to what
is sometimes called a 'safe place'. I started from the poem; &lt;em&gt;No man Is
an island&lt;/em&gt; by Jon Donne, That was also the title of the publication. The
poem starts;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*No man is an island, Entire of itself, Every man is a piece of the
continent, A part of the main.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Donne's Poem embodies a notion of the self.  -  In the way that one
cannot separate the act of cutting from the knife; we cannot separate
the self, and the acts that manifest it, from our identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to explore this &lt;strong&gt;bound&lt;/strong&gt; connection the publication intended
to make public, or share, the self  the island  using the only one
available: my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing one\'s identity, or the personal characteristics that make it
up, is an inherent part of being in a community. Time spent within this
community, of any kind, but specifically when it transcends a
sensibility, allows individuals to access each other on a more personal
level; gradually learning what it is that makes up their respective
viewpoints. Reflected in Donne's poem by the lines, "Every man is a
piece of the continent, / A part of the main."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transcendence from sensibility to community is a key intersection
within the construction of a community; &lt;strong&gt;to&lt;/strong&gt; one that is able to
actually comprehend or know the viewpoint (subjectivities) of our
"comrades", rather than merely know &lt;strong&gt;of&lt;/strong&gt; them. Of course, the sharing
or making public of our self is in no way rare. In a time when updating,
posting, and sharing is an integral part of everyday life, we
perpetually publish our inner subjectivities, for various means but
often with the undertone of "to be heard". So on a societal level the
act of constructing one's impossible island, is a retreat that in its
own farsity, highlights its inherent absence from the larger debate
around a community in contemporary society. A drive for community that
is of course not resolved by a retreat, but would come at this point of
permeability when sensibility mixes with community, &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; the
coastlines/ borders begin to open up to the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play No Man is an Island Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| No man is an island,
| Entire of itself,
| Every man is a piece of the continent,
| A part of the main.
| If a clod be washed away by the sea,
| Europe is the less.
| As well as if a promontory were.
| As well as if a manor of thy friend\'s
| Or of thine own were:
| Any man\'s death diminishes me,
| Because I am involved in mankind,
| And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
| It tolls for thee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Balance not Substance by Sarah Jones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In balance not substance,there is a continual switching taking place
between the position of the isolated and the other. The man's positions
is admired and desired, as if half of this community of two needs the
others halves attempts at retreat. But then ultimately she watches over
his house burn with a new sense of admiration; now as if he's lost his
island - forced to open up to the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this Publication this text takes the position of the other,
embodying the community or the outsider, through the man's attempts at
retreat. Where the video creates a farse at the idea of retreat from
within, by subjectifying the outsider as the person behind the camera,
balance not substance re-articulates this outside position to one that
encapsulates a wanting of permeability. In other words, whether retreat
is necessary or not, a community doesn't need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video was made through a collaboration with Amir Avraham at the
werkplaats that in itself became somewhat of a case study of a
community, permeability and these &lt;em&gt;coastlines. -&lt;/em&gt;That are evident within
artistic collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the conception of this project, a specific statement has guided my
own understanding of the island: &lt;em&gt;what can you bring to the table?&lt;/em&gt;
Essentially, what of you or of your practice is given to this shared
work? This act of sharing, or being appropriated &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; within a
collaboration is a relevant example of the breakdown of borders that
lead to a cohesive collaboration as an example of a community. Of course
this places a lot of ownership over ideas behind a work and in itself is
a detrimental avenue of thought in collaboration. But I raise the point
to ask: Can one only collaborate, only be a part of a community, or is
it integral to this process of sharing to retreat, to find a "safe
place" in an effort to return with more? Or does this process simply
entail being reminded of what you are in a time when the rising tide of
subjectivity that we experience as users  and also as artists 
seems to wash us away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\"Welcome to Econotopia: commons of the contemporary &lt;/em&gt;addresses areas
of transgression, ranging from institutions of culture to contemporary
hubs of spectacle to the internet. A portmanteau of 'economy' and
'topia', the term econotopia is coined by artist Stephanie Rothenberg
and draws on Foucault's term 'heterotopias', which he employs in an
analysis of social and cultural spaces. These delineations could include
geo-political conflicts, border crossings, gender-bending, cultural
configurations of nature and the creation of meccas of contemporary art.
Within these non-hegemonic spaces, physical forms or states of mind
offer the transgression of these very same borders. The exchange systems
and the currencies that operate within these crossings are the focus of
this contribution to Marfa Summer School 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of enclosure brings to mind delimiting some form of spatial
terrain in a field of wide openness, reining in the freedom to roam. But
by the very nature of building fences or even walled gardens,
delineation occurs, giving rise to the idea of property and building
constructs of power. As knowledge and opinion become harder to access,
transmission only becomes possible through cracks in the infrastructure.
High tech surveillance systems monitor borders, keeping tabs on migrants
through 'technotopia'. Therefore our contemporary landscape is measured
by the extent of our personal mobility and the ability to freely cross
borders privileges some citizens over others.\"&lt;/p&gt;

in &lt;strong&gt;`Building 98
\&amp;lt;http://www.haciendadelarcon.org/Building98.html&gt;`__&lt;/strong&gt; in Marfa,
Texas. During the second edition of Summer School Marfa they will
explore this town in the high desert in West Texas, the impressive
landscape and the legendary works of Donald Judd. For three weeks they
will expand contemporary discourses, social practices and politics in
art. By creating a unique experience they will gain an understanding of
the dynamics and social impact of art in public spaces.  **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marfa was built during the Texas oil boom in the late 19th century.
During the Mexican revolution (1910-1915), the US Army established a
presence in the outskirts.  The army maintained a presence during World
War 2. During the war, German prisoners of war were housed at the Fort
Russell where they obtained expansive murals of West Texas Living. In
1973 Judd moved to Marfa. He realized several large-scale artworks that
are inseparable from the desert landscape and commissioned his
contemporaries to develop art works in a former military fortress. Due
to the presence of the &lt;a href="http://www.juddfoundation.org/"&gt;Judd
Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.chinati.org/"&gt;Chinati
Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, Marfa became one of the major art
hubs in the U.S., a place where the art world meets and the cultural
industry is thriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supervised by tutors from the participating institutions, students
examine the natural -- and cultural historical and sociological meanings
of the area. They analyze the different actors in the transformation of
the area and will critically relate to the value and importance of
public art in this specific context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The curriculum is built up around three different program lines;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A deep reading of the work and writings of Judd, the impact of his legacy on contemporary art, Marfa and the meaning of preservation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An understanding and experience of the desert landscape, the impact of climate change and land use on it's ecology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The socio-political history and present of the town that nowadays provides a home for high art landscape and headquarters of National Security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Summer School Marfa many subjects related to the conflicting
ideas and issues that arose with Judds arrival in Marfa and with his
legacy will be researched. These subjects include: the history of the
area, the border, the Mexican-American war, the geology, geography,
psychogeography of the region, the specifics of the town government as
well as a structural examination of the Judd -- and Chinati Foundation,
the expanding of the US border Patrol and the local Latino history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tess Faria And Ben Burtenshaw will return the Anchor to Deptford high
street. The anchor was originally intended as a monument to Deptford\'s
maritime history. But in recent times had been appropriated by the
community to represent something new. In April 2013 it was removed by
Lewisham Council to create a "welcoming, open 'entrance' to the
street ".Through a one hour performance the anchor will be \'dropped\'
on to Deptford. With the help of the community the now silenced space at
the end of the high street will be re-appropriated. Highlighting how
this site has served to mediate with an altering local identity/ history
not always relevant to war. And what this silenced space now means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image_5" src="images/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/image_5.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The anchor that once adorned the High St will be \'dropped\' on to
Deptford. Participants will walk down the street collecting materials to
briefly reconstruct the anchor and then remove it after the 2 minute
silence. With the help of the community the now silenced space at the
end of the high street will be re-appropriated. Highlighting altered
local identity; separate to a maritime heritage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday 10th November : we are beginning to understand this performance
as an act of rekindling/ sparking, in a conflict between some of
Deptford\'s community and the development process taking place there.
The contingent we have assembled to join in this performance are key in
the rekindling/sparking process as sites of and potential sites of
disdain or activism. How they approach, ignore or come to terms with
this existing site of conflict will become evident over lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow a contingent of fourteen people will walk from The Albany,
Deptford to the south end of Deptford high street; the previous site of
an anchor monument. The contingent will lay down bin bags in the shape
of an anchor on the ground. We will wait for 2 minutes during the
organised silence and then remove the bags and return to the Albany.
After this we will meet back at our studio for a shared lunch in front
of the fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;I\'m Daniel Gaffney, an anthropology graduate and English teacher. I participated in &lt;em&gt;turn right at the anchor, &lt;/em&gt;2013. I arrived at the Albany to see Tess Faria and Ben Burtenshaw sifting and filtering through a large pile of rubbish and filling bin bags. Ben then gave us a briefing on what we were about to do, at this point the event seemed disjointed from me and the other participants. We then began walking down the high street in a uniformed manner. Once we had "reconstructed the anchor" we observed the 2 minute silence. We then returned down the high street, and later met Tess and Ben at their studio for lunch. This element of the piece seemed fundamental in understanding what we\'d been a part of. Ben described how our involvement had made us sights of "disdain or activism". The explanation and theory of the event gave clarity to me and the others involved, the purpose was evident.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;LETTER ONE -- Participation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Members, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently become a member of Generator but have previouslyonly practiced outside of Dundee. In August, Generator will hostit's first ever Members General Meeting (MGM). This will be a curated response to the committee's performance, 'Opening', at the2013 Members' Show. For many organisations the AGM or MGM is a legal requirement andwill supply two main functions: To elect a committee and to enablemembers to have a say about the running of the organization, in turn
increasing accountability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next 3 months, I will ask members and the committee to raise open questions. I will then draft an itinerary and agenda fromthese; that highlights the collective concerns and confusions, in order to facilitate an open conversation. First of all I would like to ask for questions around member'sparticipation. For example; "Could members curate one show peryear?"Please could you reply to &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#109;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#64;&amp;#103;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#112;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#106;&amp;#101;&amp;#99;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;"&gt;&amp;#109;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#64;&amp;#103;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#112;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#106;&amp;#101;&amp;#99;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&lt;/a&gt; by the June 23rd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best, Ben Burtenshaw (GENERATORmember) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;LETTER TWO -- Committee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Members, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your responses to my previous letter; Particpation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write to you now, to find your concerns specifically associated with the committee: Moreover, the relationship between the committee
and members. This letter is accompanied by a similar letter thatwill only be sent to the current committee. In order to open the process of drafting an agenda for the MGM Ihave made a wiki: www.generatormgm.eu As well as replying to this email, you are welcome to input to this open process. Please send responses to &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#109;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#64;&amp;#103;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#112;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#106;&amp;#101;&amp;#99;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;"&gt;&amp;#109;&amp;#103;&amp;#109;&amp;#64;&amp;#103;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#112;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#106;&amp;#101;&amp;#99;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&lt;/a&gt; -- a closedemail address that only I can access. I look forward to hearing your
responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best, Ben Burtenshaw (GENERATORmember) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Please note that the date for the MGM has been scheduled for the 17th of August, 4-6pm &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Original Letter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended the member's show in february: As a response to the performance which I perceived as a challenge on the involvement of member's outside of the annual show. I wish to propose a solo show at Generator Projects. I am a London based artist with no involvement, past my visit to your member's show, in the Dundee art community
. I am interested in becoming a fully fledged member and then exploring the role I can take within the organisation without any traditional participation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solo show in this instance representing the outlandish reward as a challenge to perceived lack in participation. Look forward to discussing this idea further with you, I have attached a CV and portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Tess Faria and Ben Burtenshaw conducted a research project in
the Montmell area of the Baix de Penedes. During this time they
collaborated with Cerrca as a main base for conversation and reflection
on their project; Abandonar.eu. The body of work developed out of a
series of walks to, from and around Marmellar and Selma, two abandoned
villages within walking distance of the El Pla de Manlleu. Their stay
culminated in a live broadcast of visual art works and texts from their
body of research into the history of the villages. The villages
functioned as dual points of reference; acting as guidelines within the
project and as markers for later return.From the conception of the
project Tess and Ben planned for abandonar.eu to facilitate further art
works, advancing on this body of research: in March 2014 they will
pursue this aim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition, &lt;em&gt;Try As We Might&lt;/em&gt;, is a new body of work from
 Benjamin's time in residency at SSW. The work is a continuation of 
 his practice as a study of the references shared by artists and  &lt;br&gt;
 tradesmen, having grown up working with his father. Looking at the 
 materials historically valued within the arts, such as granite or&lt;br&gt;
 bronze, Benjamin explores how they translate into domestic       &lt;br&gt;
 contexts, for example granite worktops on pre-fabricated melamine&lt;br&gt;
 units, and then back into an arts language. His work juxtaposes  &lt;br&gt;
 these materials and the shared trade references with works such as 
 granite placed on carpet tiles, cast bronze on high glossed MDF  &lt;br&gt;
 and abstract objects created within standard trade dimensions.\"&lt;/p&gt;

traditional hangover of a sunny Saturday morning; I felt it was the
right time to begin the online discourse that will hopefully supplement
our critical forum 5- 35. The feedback that I have received so far seems
good, focusing mainly on a constructive yet enjoyable time. I definitely
felt this was a warm meeting of peers and hopefully friends, and was
certainly not the critical Tomatina that a 'crit' can so often be. I'd
like to thank Joanna, Josh, Laura and Alan for sharing their practices
with us, and everyone else for attending and contributing. It would be
great if this email stream [now blog] could now become a way of
sharing the referrals that were maybe illegibly written down in the heat
of conversation and the brilliant eureka moments that came to us in the
car ride home. I'd like to start the ball rolling with a recommendation
for no one in particular; an article in this month's Art Monthly called
'Paul O'kane on making art'. Its on the first page but sadly isn't
available online. There is however a copy in the SSW library."&lt;/p&gt;
