&lt;p&gt;No Man Is an Island, a video work within a printed publication, contains
three perspectives on solitude within a community. That through
fictional text and video, explore the notion of being alone as a
potential component in the formation of micro communities. No Man Is an
Island asks the question; is there still a place for solitude, left
within our perpetually sharing-making-public-digitised society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No man is an Island&lt;/em&gt; was developed at the Dutch Art Institute, as part
of &lt;em&gt;Community in print;&lt;/em&gt; Curated by Casco, Utrecht.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\"Community in Print focuses on serial publishing inspired by
art-publishing enterprises that were for the most part in series form:
from magazines prevalent in the 1970s like the American counterculture
catalog, published by writer Stewart Brand, Whole Earth Catalog or the
collective General Idea's FILE magazine, to more contemporary examples
such as artist, critic, philosopher, and writer workgroup Chto Delat's
newspaper that takes the name of the collective, the bilingual magazine
Pages, which looks into the Iranian context and initiated by Nasrin
Tabatabai &amp;amp; Babak Afrassiabi or artist Can Atlay's journal Ahali. What
is significantly in common among them, are their self-institutional
agency. Be the vehicle a journal, magazine, or periodical, they offer a
space for ongoing, self-disciplinary practices of artistic research.
This space, in turn, forms a community of readers and interferes in
existing cultural spheres. \" &lt;a href="http://cascoprojects.org/community-in-print-the-fourth-edition-of-publishing-class-2013-2014"&gt;(Casco,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Long before the fall the tower stood taller than the town hall.
Taller than the courthouse, the neon signs on the gas stations. Dwarfed
only by the distant ring of mountains, it shone endlessly in the desert.
It shone with the silver of a star, ignored and distant. Holding our
water but not our imaginations; a monument to the benign. It still
shines, but it shines here on the new ground, the risen ground. The
glittering sunspot is our obsession. We stare into its blinding light
and tell it over and over again of our tragedy. We tell the shining
tower, with a virulent regret, of how we gave it our train, our trees
and our mountains. We feed the tower the ghosts of everything it has
already swallowed. And the shining tower, in whose shadow we kneel, the
shining tower who took our town, is all we have left. It casts its
shadow inside of us and out, it is our only shade. We sit in its
darkness now and the sounds we make are echoed and reuttered for us by
our tower.2 We whistle into its darkness. It masters our voices as we
retell its story. Everything is smaller now. One hundred miles between
lilac and silver,3 reduced to a diameter of forty feet of steel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since we lost the things we loved to see, we have started to listen.
Sound is something else without the amphitheatre of the lost mountains.
It's something close to us that lives with hot breath in the empty
silver belly of our tower. We empty ourselves into the tower,
confessionally we flood its emptiness, as it flooded ours. We talk about
events that preceded the flood but the time lines have fallen apart, our
memories collide and collapse into one another. We can no longer date
the sculptures or the storms. We remember the explosion and we remember
the flood. Everything else is evaporating history and we know that as
our stories dissolve, our past straightens out into a fine line. First
the explosion, then the fall. The tower holds these things for us.
Nature eats everything else.\"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footnote 2 Monuments and ruins act as "sentinel[s] of historicism"
(Sadek) within society, keeping the process of &lt;em&gt;history making&lt;/em&gt; on a
linear trajectory. They intervene in the process of remembering and
forgetting. However, only monuments utilise a remembering forgetting in
order to sustain a perpetual forward motion regardless of the
ramifications. They do not implore an amnesia but instead, an assignment
of the present to the past, or a &lt;em&gt;putting on record&lt;/em&gt;. This is manifested
in the use of commemoration over memory that removes the wound of the
event but maintains &lt;em&gt;honour&lt;/em&gt; or potential for revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the monument, the ruin dutifully retreats to allow an object to
act as "aestheticized dilapidation." (Sadek) This object holds "two
opposing tendencies of ruination and edification, of life and death"
from here we can either enter into the commemoration of past events,
mechanised through nostalgic formalism, or we can "stand outside
nostalgic formalism and recognize in the ruin the synthesis which
overcomes the terms of a false and ancient enmity." In order for the
ruin to convince us to commemorate, it is fundamental that it is not
current. Being in the past removes the ruin from a heightened state of
urgency. "In this form [the ruin], we thus feel the vitality of those
opposing tendencies-and, instinctively sensing these antitheses in
ourselves, we notice, beyond everything merely formal and aesthetic, the
significance of the configuration in whose serene unity they have their
synthesis." (Simmel 381) Like the monument, the ruin, stepped back from
urgency, is capable of commemoration over memory, which is fundamental
in the maintenance of a linear history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruins perform their historicist role most fully when employed to
expedite the withdrawal of the negative from the present. In other
words, the catastrophe that may inhabit the present and bind it tight to
the crushing weight of its own unyielding presentness must be swiftly
evicted and efficiently framed as a ruin, lest our resident belief in a
planned and better future be hindered and jeopardized." (Sadek 1) Here,
Sadek describes how the ruin expedites the negative from the present and
into the past by masking the ramifications of past events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reza Negerastani's analysis of a ramification in relation to a
commitment to human can be used here to explain the nature of a
ramification on the present from the past: "By eroding the anchoring
link between present commitments and their past, and by seeing present
commitments from the perspective of their ramifications, revision forces
the updating of present commitments in a cascading fashion that spreads
globally over the entire system. The rational structure of a commitment,
or more specifically, of commitment to humanity, constructs the
opportunities of the present by cultivating the positive trends of the
past through the revisionary forces of the future." (Negarestani) If one
compares this orientation of the ramification - here through reason,
rather than through the disregard that takes place within Sadek's
definition of a monument or ruin - the anti-revisionary potential that
Sadek sets out above is exposed by Negerastani's commitment to human.
The present is "cultivated" through its connection to the past, rather
than through commemoration, which masks the past and in turn the
ramifications of the present.\"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to present to you two of the works from the publication I've
assembled, as a part of Casco's community in print. The publication, is
yet to be printed, but will include a video [contained on a DVD] ;
that I'll show. and 2 text's; one of which I'll read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publication explores the position of the individual or self within
producing a community. Focussing on the process that takes place when
one shares their 'self' with a community -- and how this relates to the
perpetual sharing of ones self, as a subject viewpoint, that takes place
in contemporary society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Essentially what is it in this act of 'opening up' or becoming social
that eventually adds to, or takes away from a community? And when is a
closing down or&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;retreat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;necessary to maintain one self; in turn the
community as a whole.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a way of investigating, this act of retreat, or closing down to what
is sometimes called a 'safe place'. I started from the poem; &lt;em&gt;No man Is
an island&lt;/em&gt; by Jon Donne, That was also the title of the publication. The
poem starts;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*No man is an island, Entire of itself, Every man is a piece of the
continent, A part of the main.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon Donne's Poem embodies a notion of the self.  -  In the way that one
cannot separate the act of cutting from the knife; we cannot separate
the self, and the acts that manifest it, from our identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to explore this &lt;strong&gt;bound&lt;/strong&gt; connection the publication intended
to make public, or share, the self  the island  using the only one
available: my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing one\'s identity, or the personal characteristics that make it
up, is an inherent part of being in a community. Time spent within this
community, of any kind, but specifically when it transcends a
sensibility, allows individuals to access each other on a more personal
level; gradually learning what it is that makes up their respective
viewpoints. Reflected in Donne's poem by the lines, "Every man is a
piece of the continent, / A part of the main."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transcendence from sensibility to community is a key intersection
within the construction of a community; &lt;strong&gt;to&lt;/strong&gt; one that is able to
actually comprehend or know the viewpoint (subjectivities) of our
"comrades", rather than merely know &lt;strong&gt;of&lt;/strong&gt; them. Of course, the sharing
or making public of our self is in no way rare. In a time when updating,
posting, and sharing is an integral part of everyday life, we
perpetually publish our inner subjectivities, for various means but
often with the undertone of "to be heard". So on a societal level the
act of constructing one's impossible island, is a retreat that in its
own farsity, highlights its inherent absence from the larger debate
around a community in contemporary society. A drive for community that
is of course not resolved by a retreat, but would come at this point of
permeability when sensibility mixes with community, &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; the
coastlines/ borders begin to open up to the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play No Man is an Island Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| No man is an island,
| Entire of itself,
| Every man is a piece of the continent,
| A part of the main.
| If a clod be washed away by the sea,
| Europe is the less.
| As well as if a promontory were.
| As well as if a manor of thy friend\'s
| Or of thine own were:
| Any man\'s death diminishes me,
| Because I am involved in mankind,
| And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
| It tolls for thee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read Balance not Substance by Sarah Jones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In balance not substance,there is a continual switching taking place
between the position of the isolated and the other. The man's positions
is admired and desired, as if half of this community of two needs the
others halves attempts at retreat. But then ultimately she watches over
his house burn with a new sense of admiration; now as if he's lost his
island - forced to open up to the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this Publication this text takes the position of the other,
embodying the community or the outsider, through the man's attempts at
retreat. Where the video creates a farse at the idea of retreat from
within, by subjectifying the outsider as the person behind the camera,
balance not substance re-articulates this outside position to one that
encapsulates a wanting of permeability. In other words, whether retreat
is necessary or not, a community doesn't need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video was made through a collaboration with Amir Avraham at the
werkplaats that in itself became somewhat of a case study of a
community, permeability and these &lt;em&gt;coastlines. -&lt;/em&gt;That are evident within
artistic collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the conception of this project, a specific statement has guided my
own understanding of the island: &lt;em&gt;what can you bring to the table?&lt;/em&gt;
Essentially, what of you or of your practice is given to this shared
work? This act of sharing, or being appropriated &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; within a
collaboration is a relevant example of the breakdown of borders that
lead to a cohesive collaboration as an example of a community. Of course
this places a lot of ownership over ideas behind a work and in itself is
a detrimental avenue of thought in collaboration. But I raise the point
to ask: Can one only collaborate, only be a part of a community, or is
it integral to this process of sharing to retreat, to find a "safe
place" in an effort to return with more? Or does this process simply
entail being reminded of what you are in a time when the rising tide of
subjectivity that we experience as users  and also as artists 
seems to wash us away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exhibition, &lt;em&gt;Try As We Might&lt;/em&gt;, is a new body of work from
 Benjamin's time in residency at SSW. The work is a continuation of 
 his practice as a study of the references shared by artists and  &lt;br&gt;
 tradesmen, having grown up working with his father. Looking at the 
 materials historically valued within the arts, such as granite or&lt;br&gt;
 bronze, Benjamin explores how they translate into domestic       &lt;br&gt;
 contexts, for example granite worktops on pre-fabricated melamine&lt;br&gt;
 units, and then back into an arts language. His work juxtaposes  &lt;br&gt;
 these materials and the shared trade references with works such as 
 granite placed on carpet tiles, cast bronze on high glossed MDF  &lt;br&gt;
 and abstract objects created within standard trade dimensions.\"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5-35 was an opportunity for artists based in rural Aberdeenshire to
enter in to critical conversation around their work. The forum was based
at the Scottish Sculpture Workshop, leading the conversations to be
focused on a 'shop talk' or industry specific discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As the hangovers of discourse from Thursday night are now met by the
traditional hangover of a sunny Saturday morning; I felt it was the
right time to begin the online discourse that will hopefully supplement
our critical forum 5- 35. The feedback that I have received so far seems
good, focusing mainly on a constructive yet enjoyable time. I definitely
felt this was a warm meeting of peers and hopefully friends, and was
certainly not the critical Tomatina that a 'crit' can so often be. I'd
like to thank Joanna, Josh, Laura and Alan for sharing their practices
with us, and everyone else for attending and contributing. It would be
great if this email stream [now blog] could now become a way of
sharing the referrals that were maybe illegibly written down in the heat
of conversation and the brilliant eureka moments that came to us in the
car ride home. I'd like to start the ball rolling with a recommendation
for no one in particular; an article in this month's Art Monthly called
'Paul O'kane on making art'. Its on the first page but sadly isn't
available online. There is however a copy in the SSW library."&lt;/p&gt;
