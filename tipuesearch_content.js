Workshop Description From : https://www.cais.nrw/veranstaltungen/what-is-the-art-in-artificial-intelligence/ SUSI.ai: What is the Art in Artificial Intelligence? brings together a group of international researchers in an open and experimental format that explores the ‘future of search' with an opensource personal assistant SUSI.ai . With hands-on interaction and a ‘behind the scenes' in-depth analysis by Michael Christen, along with the interests and expertise of the participants, the event will focus on teaching ‘art' to artificial intelligence – contributing content to SUSI's library of potential answers so that it could ‘learn'. The event also intends to investigate some of the consequences of feeding and training AI concerning digital labour and gender bias with Personal Assistants along with ‘surveillance activities' in the home and office. Besides linguistic understanding, ethics of AI will also be explored regarding questions of teaching AI and ways in which AI could be trained differently.

Research Paper Paper Abstract In recent years an increasing number of analyses of offensive language has been published, however, dealing mainly with the automatic detection and classification of isolated instances. In this paper we aim to understand the impact of offensive messages in online conversations diachronically, and in particular the change in offensiveness of dialogue turns. In turn,we aim to measure the progression of of-fence level as well as its direction – For example, whether a conversation is escalating or declining in offence. We present our method of extracting linear dialogues from tree-structured conversations in social media data and make our code publicly available.1Furthermore, we discuss methods to analyse this dataset through changes in discourse offensiveness. Our paper includes two main contributions;first, using a neural network to measure the level of offensiveness in conversations;and second, the analysis of conversations around offensive comments using decoupling functions.","tags":"PhD","url":"www.burtenshaw.xyz/528.html","loc":"www.burtenshaw.xyz/528.html"},{"title":"Visiting Researcher at CISUC, The University of Coimbra","text":"As part of the PhD at the University of Antwerp I visited The Cognitive and Media Systems Group at The University of Coimbra.

This a protracted and nuanced task, that should become an integral part of my PhD. As yet we have been able to detect conversation 'Offence Direction', i.e. whether conversations are becoming more or less offensive. This novel outcome has used a bespoke Reddit dataset, the code for which we've published on github . In 2020 we will publish a long paper on the details of this metric: Future Paper Abstract This paper outlines an ongoing corpus study and gradient based search of conversations by offence probability direction; for example, becoming more or less offensive. With the motivation of retrieving examples of humans' conversational tactics against offence. Such a database would be a lucrative resource in evaluating dialogue systems on the same task, where a central challenge is dealing with offensive input. This problem is compounded when working in ethically sensitive areas, where replies should be validated and context appropriate. Literature from care and pedagogy advises professionals that when subjects become offensive, methods like expansion, clarification, and adaptation are necessary rather than warning alone. By appropriately handling the offence, the professional carer removes blame and opens the door for the subject to process their intention. However, these nuanced and delicate forms of language are challenging to implement in a dialogue system, from conceptual literature alone. We use state of the art offence classification from the recent Offenseval 2019 Task 6. We predict an offence direction based on linear gradients of the classification probability.","tags":"PhD","url":"www.burtenshaw.xyz/'nlg_offensive_language'.html","loc":"www.burtenshaw.xyz/'nlg_offensive_language'.html"},{"title":"The Internet of Things","text":"As a continuation of the Asibot project, I gave a presentation to the internet of things conference in Rotterdam. With Enrique Manjavacas , I then gave a more technical and hands-on workshop for bachelors and masters students, where we explained in detail how asibot worked, as well as discussing the conceptual challenges in language generation. Abstract Presentation : Synthetic Literature - Writing Science Fiction in a Co-Creative Process - Ben Burtenshaw (The University of Antwerp) Synthetic literature refers to stories written with and by machines. The lecture outlines a natural language generation project named Asibot, that allowed members of the public to collaborate in the writing of a science fiction story with a neural network based text generator. Crucially, the system set up a collaborative environment, through which users were able to creatively write. The lecture will focus on the ramifications of this creative process, and go in to detail on how one evaluates and analyses it. It would be interesting for those working with natural language generation or processing, as well those who are interested in recent developments in the fields of computational creativity and story generation. Workshop Asibot, Under the Hood - Ben Burtenshaw & Enrique Manjavacas (The University of Antwerp) In this workshop, Ben Burtenshaw will follow up on his plenary lecture, and show participants how the Asibot system works on a more practical level. You will get the opportunity to interact with the Asibot system, a neural network based text generator that wrote a science fiction story in collaboration with Dutch writer Ronald Giphart. Since the project's public completion, researchers at the The University of Antwerp and The Meertens Institute have been analysing how Asibot was used.

The alternative worlds they produce encourage imagination and creativity, but also transform knowledge into structures that children can understand and relate to. We present an interactive story system that creates narratives from Wikipedia articles, and reveals them through dialogue with a user. Using state-of-the-art narrative generation tools and a chatbot dialogue system, information from Wikipedia is revealed to the child based on their input. Generating narratives from any text has long been a goal of Artificial Intelligence researchers because narrative structures are useful for learners of all ages. However, many of the existing story generation systems have relied on hand - written techniques that cannot meet the scale of data online. In recent years search - based systems have been able to incorporate broader topics, but they have sacrificed continuity, producing fragmented narrative. Here we propose a search - based system that scours Wikipedia for articles relating to user input, and then restricts its generation material to that article; in doing so, the system utilises the defined topic and chronology of the article to retain context.

As an event, Prometheanism 2.0 is a condensed and partial account of this strain of thought that cuts across rationalism, pragmatism, realism, materialism, science, technology, computation, economics, politics, and art to shape its foundations. It attempts to articulate the major positions, concerns, and questions for a contemporary prometheanism through both theoretical talks and artistic representations. In which sense can art practice be promethean? Where does the urge come from? Why and how should art take on this challenge? This event hopes to bring to the table discussions and questions regarding a contemporary promethean position and its embrace in art practice, contributing to further sharpening, clarifying, and formulating a prometheanism 2.0 that, to an extent, still remains germinal. READ MORE by Bassam El Baroni , curator, writer and core theory-tutor, DAI Description of my contribution Often when we attempt to visualise prometheanism, we use some version of science-fiction cyborg as technology's best effort at human, a Human 2.0. But prometheanism is more nuanced than just advancement. To see this, we need to look past humans running faster and living longer in a distant utopian future, and put prometheanism alongside other planetary scaled challenges. Beyond Cyborgs attempts to ignore the initial desire for advancement, that prometheanism conjures up, and instead asks 'what does prometheanism look like in a state of survival?' To grasp this interpretation, the audio performance samples science fiction novels which move beyond the traditional cyborg in cinematic portrayals. These narratives tackle humanity through complex uses of prometheanism, based on technologies completely separate from our own. They are based on biological or psychological enhancement, rather than digital technology. Through this they offer a version of prometheanism that can be applied to contemporary issues, without seeming far-fetched.","tags":"Art & Technology","url":"www.burtenshaw.xyz/'prometheanism-2-0-roaming-assembly-symposium-by-bassam-el-baroni'.html","loc":"www.burtenshaw.xyz/'prometheanism-2-0-roaming-assembly-symposium-by-bassam-el-baroni'.html"},{"title":"'did you feel it?' A SYMPOSIUM ON DIGITAL INTERFACES AND THEIR AFFECT","text":"The Premise of the symposium The symposium \"did you feel it ?\" will approach the concern of how affect manifests through technology, by taking the idea of the interface as a way of understanding the creation and mediation of affective forces and their influence on our social, political and artistic encounters. Affect can be defined as as \"a pre-personal intensity corresponding to the passage from one experiential state of the body to another and implying an augmentation or diminution in that body\\'s capacity to act.\" (Brian Massumi) In our contemporary situation these experiential states and feelings are readily exchanged and traded upon in many areas of life: Your Facebook friends are editing and mediating their lives so that you can engage with them through liking and sharing. News media increasingly appeals to us on an affective register, influencing our reactions from occupation to commodification. With the growth of the service industry, an increasing number of workers no longer merely exchange the labour of their bodies, rather they exchange on an affective spectrum, like the call centre worker who must present a relentless kind and civil demeanor, no matter what. What we do in the media is enabled and disabled by interfaces. The interface is the ubiquitous and largely hidden layer between human and machine, but its transparency does not make it neutral. It is also an autonomous zone of aesthetic activity, guided by its own logic and its own ends. (Alexander Galloway). The interface permanently shapes our view of the material, the social, the political and the technological. This premise was written in May by myself, Jammie Nicholas and Miguel Ángel Rego Robles . Through writing this and developing the whole symposium, we were supported by Jorinde Seijdel, the editor for Open , and artist Florian Göttke .

Availible at Open! This essay (part of the Open! Co-Op Academy project \"did you feel it?\") is concerned with how affective forces move through our technological encounters and how technology itself can alter these, as well as their perception within our brain. It's not so much about the exchanges between one another, as about the situations where other, non-human, intelligences come into the fray. How and where do these intelligences manifest and what psychology do they bring about? In the latter part of the essay, I'll compare some examples with existing theories of affective labour in order to give us an idea of what could come of these forces in the future. Affective labour has become central to consumer capitalism, seen in the prevalence of roles like the call centre worker, and so related theories can show how capital already functions affectively.

Whilst there Jennings developed a sound work that using Devodama's technology analyses the electrical impedance of a plant, and applies correlating audio to its fluctuations. For the Edinburgh Science Festival, the artists were interested in the terms that art and science meet. For example how poetry can move beyond the illustration of scientific data, and in turn how scientific data can find an affective resonance through poetry. Jones' poem New things was written in response to Jenning's first work, specifically the moment when one encounters the familiar rhythm of nature, mediated by technology. For this project though, Devodama's technology has been applied to continuously reconfigure the stanzas of Sarah Jones' poem. Jennings' video work also titled Bio-Symphony , explains the association of the plant and technology with his artistic practice. As well as the specific stories and beliefs of Devodama, the inventors of the technology. Their private eco-village in Italy has a very spiritual understanding of why the plant can make sounds, which Jennings had to understand in order to research this science. Opening: 3rd April 2015, as part of 'How the lights get in' @ Summerhall , during Edinburgh science festival. Oliver Jenning's uses video and sound to reveal the inner workings of natural structures. It\\'s this inquisitive philosophy which led to his work Every Object Has A Spirit [2012], which was concerned with exploring and finding ways of generating patterns from life-cycles in nature. Oliver's work wishes to explore past art's capacity to illustrate science, and engage directly with the emotive and psychological ramifications of what these patterns mean. Ultimately his works aims to use technology to explore and understand nature. Sarah Jones (1982) is an artist, writer and curator.

The text was produced in Colaboration with Sarah Jones whilst on residency in Marfa, as a part of TAAK\\'s Summer School . The full text can be found at amoving.net . \"Long before the fall the tower stood taller than the town hall. Taller than the courthouse, the neon signs on the gas stations. Dwarfed only by the distant ring of mountains, it shone endlessly in the desert. It shone with the silver of a star, ignored and distant. Holding our water but not our imaginations; a monument to the benign. It still shines, but it shines here on the new ground, the risen ground. The glittering sunspot is our obsession. We stare into its blinding light and tell it over and over again of our tragedy. We tell the shining tower, with a virulent regret, of how we gave it our train, our trees and our mountains. We feed the tower the ghosts of everything it has already swallowed. And the shining tower, in whose shadow we kneel, the shining tower who took our town, is all we have left. It casts its shadow inside of us and out, it is our only shade. We sit in its darkness now and the sounds we make are echoed and reuttered for us by our tower.2 We whistle into its darkness. It masters our voices as we retell its story. Everything is smaller now. One hundred miles between lilac and silver,3 reduced to a diameter of forty feet of steel. Since we lost the things we loved to see, we have started to listen. Sound is something else without the amphitheatre of the lost mountains. It's something close to us that lives with hot breath in the empty silver belly of our tower. We empty ourselves into the tower, confessionally we flood its emptiness, as it flooded ours. We talk about events that preceded the flood but the time lines have fallen apart, our memories collide and collapse into one another. We can no longer date the sculptures or the storms. We remember the explosion and we remember the flood. Everything else is evaporating history and we know that as our stories dissolve, our past straightens out into a fine line. First the explosion, then the fall. The tower holds these things for us. Nature eats everything else.\\\" Footnote 2 Monuments and ruins act as \"sentinel[s] of historicism\" (Sadek) within society, keeping the process of history making on a linear trajectory. They intervene in the process of remembering and forgetting. However, only monuments utilise a remembering forgetting in order to sustain a perpetual forward motion regardless of the ramifications. They do not implore an amnesia but instead, an assignment of the present to the past, or a putting on record . This is manifested in the use of commemoration over memory that removes the wound of the event but maintains honour or potential for revenge. Unlike the monument, the ruin dutifully retreats to allow an object to act as \"aestheticized dilapidation.\" (Sadek) This object holds \"two opposing tendencies of ruination and edification, of life and death\" from here we can either enter into the commemoration of past events, mechanised through nostalgic formalism, or we can \"stand outside nostalgic formalism and recognize in the ruin the synthesis which overcomes the terms of a false and ancient enmity.\" In order for the ruin to convince us to commemorate, it is fundamental that it is not current. Being in the past removes the ruin from a heightened state of urgency. \"In this form [the ruin], we thus feel the vitality of those opposing tendencies-and, instinctively sensing these antitheses in ourselves, we notice, beyond everything merely formal and aesthetic, the significance of the configuration in whose serene unity they have their synthesis.\" (Simmel 381) Like the monument, the ruin, stepped back from urgency, is capable of commemoration over memory, which is fundamental in the maintenance of a linear history. Ruins perform their historicist role most fully when employed to expedite the withdrawal of the negative from the present. In other words, the catastrophe that may inhabit the present and bind it tight to the crushing weight of its own unyielding presentness must be swiftly evicted and efficiently framed as a ruin, lest our resident belief in a planned and better future be hindered and jeopardized.\" (Sadek 1) Here, Sadek describes how the ruin expedites the negative from the present and into the past by masking the ramifications of past events. Reza Negerastani's analysis of a ramification in relation to a commitment to human can be used here to explain the nature of a ramification on the present from the past: \"By eroding the anchoring link between present commitments and their past, and by seeing present commitments from the perspective of their ramifications, revision forces the updating of present commitments in a cascading fashion that spreads globally over the entire system. The rational structure of a commitment, or more specifically, of commitment to humanity, constructs the opportunities of the present by cultivating the positive trends of the past through the revisionary forces of the future.\" (Negarestani) If one compares this orientation of the ramification - here through reason, rather than through the disregard that takes place within Sadek's definition of a monument or ruin - the anti-revisionary potential that Sadek sets out above is exposed by Negerastani's commitment to human. The present is \"cultivated\" through its connection to the past, rather than through commemoration, which masks the past and in turn the ramifications of the present.\\\" The full text can be found at amoving.net .

The publication, is yet to be printed, but will include a video [contained on a DVD] ; that I'll show. and 2 text's; one of which I'll read. The publication explores the position of the individual or self within producing a community. Focussing on the process that takes place when one shares their 'self' with a community -- and how this relates to the perpetual sharing of ones self, as a subject viewpoint, that takes place in contemporary society. Essentially what is it in this act of 'opening up' or becoming social that eventually adds to, or takes away from a community? And when is a closing down or retreat necessary to maintain one self; in turn the community as a whole. As a way of investigating, this act of retreat, or closing down to what is sometimes called a 'safe place'. I started from the poem; No man Is an island by Jon Donne, That was also the title of the publication. The poem starts; *No man is an island, Entire of itself, Every man is a piece of the continent, A part of the main.* Jon Donne's Poem embodies a notion of the self. - In the way that one cannot separate the act of cutting from the knife; we cannot separate the self, and the acts that manifest it, from our identity. In order to explore this bound connection the publication intended to make public, or share, the self the island using the only one available: my own. Sharing one\\'s identity, or the personal characteristics that make it up, is an inherent part of being in a community. Time spent within this community, of any kind, but specifically when it transcends a sensibility, allows individuals to access each other on a more personal level; gradually learning what it is that makes up their respective viewpoints. Reflected in Donne's poem by the lines, \"Every man is a piece of the continent, / A part of the main.\" This transcendence from sensibility to community is a key intersection within the construction of a community; to one that is able to actually comprehend or know the viewpoint (subjectivities) of our \"comrades\", rather than merely know of them. Of course, the sharing or making public of our self is in no way rare. In a time when updating, posting, and sharing is an integral part of everyday life, we perpetually publish our inner subjectivities, for various means but often with the undertone of \"to be heard\". So on a societal level the act of constructing one's impossible island, is a retreat that in its own farsity, highlights its inherent absence from the larger debate around a community in contemporary society. A drive for community that is of course not resolved by a retreat, but would come at this point of permeability when sensibility mixes with community, or the coastlines/ borders begin to open up to the continent. Play No Man is an Island Video | No man is an island, | Entire of itself, | Every man is a piece of the continent, | A part of the main. | If a clod be washed away by the sea, | Europe is the less. | As well as if a promontory were. | As well as if a manor of thy friend\\'s | Or of thine own were: | Any man\\'s death diminishes me, | Because I am involved in mankind, | And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; | It tolls for thee. Read Balance not Substance by Sarah Jones In balance not substance,there is a continual switching taking place between the position of the isolated and the other. The man's positions is admired and desired, as if half of this community of two needs the others halves attempts at retreat. But then ultimately she watches over his house burn with a new sense of admiration; now as if he's lost his island - forced to open up to the continent. For this Publication this text takes the position of the other, embodying the community or the outsider, through the man's attempts at retreat. Where the video creates a farse at the idea of retreat from within, by subjectifying the outsider as the person behind the camera, balance not substance re-articulates this outside position to one that encapsulates a wanting of permeability. In other words, whether retreat is necessary or not, a community doesn't need it. The video was made through a collaboration with Amir Avraham at the werkplaats that in itself became somewhat of a case study of a community, permeability and these coastlines. - That are evident within artistic collaboration. From the conception of this project, a specific statement has guided my own understanding of the island: what can you bring to the table? Essentially, what of you or of your practice is given to this shared work? This act of sharing, or being appropriated from within a collaboration is a relevant example of the breakdown of borders that lead to a cohesive collaboration as an example of a community. Of course this places a lot of ownership over ideas behind a work and in itself is a detrimental avenue of thought in collaboration. But I raise the point to ask: Can one only collaborate, only be a part of a community, or is it integral to this process of sharing to retreat, to find a \"safe place\" in an effort to return with more? Or does this process simply entail being reminded of what you are in a time when the rising tide of subjectivity that we experience as users and also as artists seems to wash us away?

A portmanteau of 'economy' and 'topia', the term econotopia is coined by artist Stephanie Rothenberg and draws on Foucault's term 'heterotopias', which he employs in an analysis of social and cultural spaces. These delineations could include geo-political conflicts, border crossings, gender-bending, cultural configurations of nature and the creation of meccas of contemporary art. Within these non-hegemonic spaces, physical forms or states of mind offer the transgression of these very same borders. The exchange systems and the currencies that operate within these crossings are the focus of this contribution to Marfa Summer School 2014. The concept of enclosure brings to mind delimiting some form of spatial terrain in a field of wide openness, reining in the freedom to roam. But by the very nature of building fences or even walled gardens, delineation occurs, giving rise to the idea of property and building constructs of power. As knowledge and opinion become harder to access, transmission only becomes possible through cracks in the infrastructure. High tech surveillance systems monitor borders, keeping tabs on migrants through 'technotopia'. Therefore our contemporary landscape is measured by the extent of our personal mobility and the ability to freely cross borders privileges some citizens over others.\\\" Course Description","tags":"Art & Technology","url":"www.burtenshaw.xyz/'welcome-econotopia-mexico-city'.html","loc":"www.burtenshaw.xyz/'welcome-econotopia-mexico-city'.html"},{"title":"Taak Summer School, Marfa, Texas","text":"\\\"From May 26 to June 14 2014, 20 students from Dutch Art Institute , the Sandberg Instituut/Gerrit Rietveld Academie ** and * `California College of Arts (CCA) \\<http://www.cca.edu/>`__ * will stay in `Building 98 \\<http://www.haciendadelarcon.org/Building98.html>`__ in Marfa, Texas. During the second edition of Summer School Marfa they will explore this town in the high desert in West Texas, the impressive landscape and the legendary works of Donald Judd. For three weeks they will expand contemporary discourses, social practices and politics in art. By creating a unique experience they will gain an understanding of the dynamics and social impact of art in public spaces. ** Marfa was built during the Texas oil boom in the late 19th century. During the Mexican revolution (1910-1915), the US Army established a presence in the outskirts. The army maintained a presence during World War 2. During the war, German prisoners of war were housed at the Fort Russell where they obtained expansive murals of West Texas Living. In 1973 Judd moved to Marfa. He realized several large-scale artworks that are inseparable from the desert landscape and commissioned his contemporaries to develop art works in a former military fortress. Due to the presence of the Judd Foundation and the Chinati Foundation , Marfa became one of the major art hubs in the U.S., a place where the art world meets and the cultural industry is thriving. Supervised by tutors from the participating institutions, students examine the natural -- and cultural historical and sociological meanings of the area. They analyze the different actors in the transformation of the area and will critically relate to the value and importance of public art in this specific context. The curriculum is built up around three different program lines; A deep reading of the work and writings of Judd, the impact of his legacy on contemporary art, Marfa and the meaning of preservation. An understanding and experience of the desert landscape, the impact of climate change and land use on it's ecology The socio-political history and present of the town that nowadays provides a home for high art landscape and headquarters of National Security. During Summer School Marfa many subjects related to the conflicting ideas and issues that arose with Judds arrival in Marfa and with his legacy will be researched. These subjects include: the history of the area, the border, the Mexican-American war, the geology, geography, psychogeography of the region, the specifics of the town government as well as a structural examination of the Judd -- and Chinati Foundation, the expanding of the US border Patrol and the local Latino history.

It would be great if this email stream [now blog] could now become a way of sharing the referrals that were maybe illegibly written down in the heat of conversation and the brilliant eureka moments that came to us in the car ride home. I'd like to start the ball rolling with a recommendation for no one in particular; an article in this month's Art Monthly called 'Paul O'kane on making art'. Its on the first page but sadly isn't available online. There is however a copy in the SSW library.\" BB, Novemebr 2012","tags":"Art Practice","url":"www.burtenshaw.xyz/'5-35-critical-forum'.html","loc":"www.burtenshaw.xyz/'5-35-critical-forum'.html"}]};
